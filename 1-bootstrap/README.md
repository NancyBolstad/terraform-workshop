## Step-by-step Guide

### Deploy first resource

Let's get started by setting up Terraform and deploy the first resource.

1. Create a new file `main.tf`
2. Set Terraform version and AWS provider: 
  ```tf
  terraform {
    required_version = "~> 1.1.7"
  }

  provider "aws" {
    region = "eu-west-1"
  }
  ```
3. Run `terraform init`
4. Add the first resource:
  ```tf
  terraform {
    required_version = "~> 1.1.7"
  }

  provider "aws" {
    region = "eu-west-1"
  }

  resource "aws_iam_user" "ci" {
    name = "CI"
  }
  ```
5. Run `terraform apply` and confirm the deployment with `yes`.

### Use data sources

Cool, we just deployed our first resource with Terraform. ðŸŽ‰ It's just an IAM user but it's something. This simple IAM user could be already helpful in deploying the Terraform stack in a CI pipeline later on. Now, let's extend the IAM user and attach an IAM policy. 

1. Go to the `main.tf` and replace it:
  ```tf
  terraform {
    required_version = "~> 1.1.7"
  }

  provider "aws" {
    region = "eu-west-1"
  }

  data "aws_iam_policy" "admin" {
    name = "AdministratorAccess"
  }

  resource "aws_iam_user" "ci" {
    name = "CI"
  }

  resource "aws_iam_user_policy_attachment" "ci" {
    user       = aws_iam_user.ci.name
    policy_arn = data.aws_iam_policy.admin.arn
  }
  ```
2. Run `terraform apply` and confirm the deployment with `yes`.

Okay, we introduced a new resource to attach a policy to the user and used a [data source](https://www.terraform.io/language/data-sources). What is it? Essentially, we can fetch data outside of Terraform and use it inside the stack. In this case, we fetch the managed policy by the name (`AdministratorAccess`) and get the policy ARN. We can then use the policy ARN for the policy attachment.
